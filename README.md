# Git Utils Node

A utility tool designed to work with Git repositories, providing functionalities such as checking lines of code (LOC) changes, filtering diffs, and more. This tool is built with Node.js and is intended for use in development environments, especially in CI/CD pipelines to enforce code quality checks.

## Features ðŸš§

- **LOC Check**: Analyze the number of lines added, deleted, or modified in a Git repository and compare against predefined limits.
- **Diff Filtering**: Apply filters to Git diffs to include or exclude specific types of changes (e.g., copied, deleted, renamed files).
- **Customizable Reports**: Generate reports in various formats (human-readable, JSON, HTML table) based on the analysis results.
- **Exclusion Lists**: Define files or directories to exclude from the analysis.


## Installation ðŸš§

This tool requires Node.js version 20.0.0 or higher.
